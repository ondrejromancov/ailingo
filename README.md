## AILingo

Hi there! AILingo is a template of a simple web app for language learning with AI. It is built with:

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vercel AI SDK

The app is missing some it's core AI features and as those are up to you to implement ðŸ˜‰

## Getting Started

First, get your OpenAI API key. Then create a copy of the `.env.template` file and rename it to `.env` . Finally update the `OPENAI_API_KEY` parameter in the new file which you've created.

Then run the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
